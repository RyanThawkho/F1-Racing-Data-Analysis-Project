# F1-Racing-Data-Analysis-Project


## Overview
This project analyzes Formula 1 data using Python, SQL, and Power BI to uncover insights on driver and constructor performance across different F1 eras.

## Process
1. **Data Collection**: Downloaded dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used Python to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Database Management**: Imported tables into Microsoft SQL Server and ran queries for analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI.
5. **Presentation**: Compiled findings into a storytelling presentation.

## Tools Used

- **SQL** (Microsoft SQL Server)
- **Power BI**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **Google Colab**

## Insights & Findings
- Ferrari dominated the V10 era, but its success declined in later eras.
- Red Bull emerged as a powerhouse in the V8 and V6 hybrid eras.
- Monaco and Monza had the highest number of DNFs, reflecting their track difficulty.
- Top drivers tend to stay with a single constructor for most of their wins.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/F1-Data-Analysis.git
